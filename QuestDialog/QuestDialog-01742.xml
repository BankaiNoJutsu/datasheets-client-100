        <Page social="0">To everyone's surprise but yours, the Stronghold of Blood was not a safe place at all. On your way to save the villagers, you and Elleon encountered an enormous castle in the sky. From out of this flying castle emerged hordes of the butterflies that you saw in Velikâ€™s dream. They attacked the refugees' transports, forcing them out of the sky. You hurried to the crash site and rescued all the survivors you could find.</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">We've decided to send the villagers to the Stronghold of Blood until this plague has been dealt with.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The area outside is dangerous, but they should be safe behind the fortifications. Please gather them up and make sure they get to the transports.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'm needed here to coordinate the evacuation, so they'll need someone they trust, and I can't think of anyone they'd trust more than you.</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">If we're going to the Stronghold of Blood, a flying transport would be the safest way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Going to the ruins was impossible after the soldiers pulled out. So, on the bright side, I'm glad I can finally go and take a look for myself.</Page>

We must get word to the transports and get those people back here.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If they land in the stronghold, they'll all be infected!</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">This is devastating...I've put everyone's lives in danger...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We must go after the transports!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They'll be flying past Serenity Valley...Velnen should be there. He can tell you if the transports have already passed by. Go! Now!&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I'm on my way!"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>

    <Text id="16" huntingZoneId="227" prevId="15" villagerId="1008">
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I'm sorry, but Laaran is mistaken; those transports won't be passing by here. They'll be flying in over the Stronghold of Blood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And I'm afraid it won't be easy getting to them in there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The route in is overrun with ferocious monsters, and we've even had to evacuate most of our camps. Even if we get past them, it will be even more difficult getting back out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For now, I'll order all the troops I can spare to the Stronghold of Blood keep the villagers safe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Until we know more, you should help by recapturing our camps.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Good plan. Leave it to me."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">There are four camps under enemy control. Clear them of monsters, and repair their teleportals so we can reoccupy the camps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can start just on the other side of the main road there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Clear out those Mutated Warthogs, then repair the teleportal.</Page>

    <Text id="17" huntingZoneId="227" prevId="16" villagerId="1033">
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Velnen's plan is sound. Our first priority is keeping the villagers safe, and that will be easier if we can keep the road clear.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"I agree."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I think the teleportal's just misaligned. It shouldn't take much to get it working again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jelena and I will help the soldiers secure the camp, then start searching for the transports. If we locate any villagers, we'll bring them here first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Good luck with the other camps. I'll catch up as soon as I can.</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">It's an honor to meet you, &lt;PCNAME&gt;. I am Hudere, Velnen's assistant. He sent me ahead to get the camps into liveable condition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you for repairing the teleportal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll follow after you with supplies after I get this place set up.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Sounds good."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Our biggest obstacle, I think, will be all those vulcans. They're going to tear our supply wagons to pieces.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you clear a path so we can get the supplies through?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I'll meet you at the next camp.</Page>

    <Text id="19" huntingZoneId="227" prevId="18" villagerId="1035">
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">The supplies made it through, thanks to you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We'll get this camp operational, and meet you at the next camp.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But...these siege weapons need repairs. We don't have the facilities to do that here.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How can I help?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Would you escort one of these siege weapons to the next camp?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They're in bad shape, so you'll have to protect it from enemy attacks... but once you get it to the camp, we'll be able to repair it, then send it back to escort the next one, and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just be quick. There's very little fuel left in the tanks right now.</Page>

I have to deliver my report.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We took heavy losses, recapturing the fourth camp, and Laaran still needs to make sure the the way is clear between here and there.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"How many soldiers did you lose?"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Not many, actually... but it was brutal, and now their morale is in the gutter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hey... on your way, why don't you collect monster teeth and show them to the troops at Camp Delta?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That should cheer them up. I'd do it myself, if we had time to wait for the rest of the siege weapons... but I'm sure you can handle it on your own.</Page>

        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">I knew this would be easy work for you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The soldiers are relieved that you got a little vengeance on those fangspawns. Thank you.&lt;NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;"Tell them the hard part's over."&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">Now that all the camps are set up, please go rescue the villagers and bring them to me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After they're safe behind the barricades, the guards will be able to keep the monsters at a safe distance.</Page>

I'm right behind you!"&lt;/NEXTPAGEBUTTON&gt;</Page>
