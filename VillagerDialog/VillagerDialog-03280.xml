        <Page social="0" voiceTypeId="0">It is my dream to collect and breed every mount in Arborea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, some very special ones are difficult to obtain on my own, so I am planning to purchasing them with passes from the Valkyon Federation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am collecting as many of them as possible since the number of pass required for each mount is very different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you get me ‘Special Mount Pass’,&lt;br&gt;which Valkyon Federation is issuing for a limited period of time,&lt;br&gt;I will give you the treasures I have collected so far in return!</Page>
